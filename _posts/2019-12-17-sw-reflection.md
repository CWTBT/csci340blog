# SW Reflection

As I partially expected, the most critical skill for this kind of project is communication, and for two reasons in particular. First, the success of the project was dependent on good communication with our client. Child Care Aware is seeking to improve their ability to service childcare providers, and the ability for them to easily use their website is crucial in doing so. It’s difficult at first, but a major step in this project was understanding that our client has far less experience with computer systems and web development than we do. In order to make the project successful, it was necessary for us to communicate with our client to find out the easiest way for them to use this website to accomplish their goals.

Communication between group members was also important, of course. Proper division of responsibilities and frequent communication of progress is always critical when working with a group. Software development for me has, up to this point, been a mostly solo endeavor. These communication skills were something I knew I was lacking in at the beginning, and I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to improve them.

The success of this project was extremely important to me particularly because I think Child Care Aware is making a difference in the state of Arkansas. One of the most important facets to ensuring high quality childcare is training people to provide it, and this is exactly what CCA does. Providing them with an improved website will only make it easier for them to provide that service, so I feel a great sense of pride in having been able to help out in some way.

As I said before, computer science has been solo work for most of my experience with it. I’ve not had many opportunities to combine it with social work. However, through this project, I’ve begun to see that they don’t necessarily have to be entirely separate fields. The kinds of projects that were conducted in this class this semester are all the kind of work that any social initiative could benefit from: software that makes their work easier. In facilitating an easier workflow for those seeking to make change, software/web developers can contribute to that social change.

Whereas social work and computer science have occupied separate areas in my headspace in the past, I can now see ways in which they can be integrated. Knowing that I am able to use my line of work to contribute meaningfully to areas of my community that I think need improvement revitalizes my desire to become a part of that change. I don’t exactly know how this will manifest in my future work, but now I’m excited to see more ways in which I might be able to contribute.
