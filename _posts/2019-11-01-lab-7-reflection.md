### Reflection
Using JQuery wasn't terribly difficult after the tutorial. We didn't have to jump through many hoops to use the APIs we picked, however some of the ones we considered before our final choices weren't entirely transparent about how their JSONs were structured. Even in the end, we had to spend some time figuring out exactly how to get the items we needed. Once we got over that hoop of understanding the JSON files, we found it very easy to get the information we needed out of both, and we were very excited to see it working so quickly afterward.
