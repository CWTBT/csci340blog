### What was new to you?
I still don't have a lot of experience with the general
layout of Jekyll blogs, and this task required a lot of
messing around with it in order to get the new theme working.

### What parts did you struggle with?
It's strange that Jekyll blogs don't seem to follow the exact
same layout. There seem to be slight differences in the file hierarchy
and location of certain files that cause big problems if you try to just
copy/paste one over the other (see: [Long Haul](https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul) vs [Massively](https://github.com/jekyllup/jekyll-theme-massively)).

### What parts are you looking forward to?
If I find some free time, it might be fun to come back and try switching
to one of the other themes and further customizing it.
