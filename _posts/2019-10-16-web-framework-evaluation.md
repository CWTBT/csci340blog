## Django
I have some passing familiarity with Django already, so this was one of the frameworks I was most excited to learn about. It seems very Pythonic in spirit, in that it looks easy to use and seems like speed of development is prioritized over other areas. The templating system is something I'm familiar with from other frameworks, so that's a big upside for me.

## Express
Express is one that I've had very minor hands-on experience with. The minimal, modular nature of it is something that I like a lot in concept, but I don't think it would help our project in any substantial way. Also, Javascript is not one of my strong areas, and I think my group is leaning away from the language as a whole.

## Ruby on Rails
I think this one looks very promising. Offers everything we need (Database model, MVC structure) and is easy to get running. It seems like it takes care of a lot of work on its own. The downside to that if all we can do is chalk up the inner workings to Rails magic, then we'll have trouble debugging any major issues we have later on.

## Flask
Again, I think the lightweight focus is an elegant concept, but not one relevant to our project. It would be more valuable to us to simply start with a more fully-featured framework (such as Django, if we really want a Python framework) than to start with Flask and have to grab extensions/libraries for everything we need.

## Laravel
I had not heard of this one, and was surprised to see that it has so many resources available for learning it. It was unexpectedly fully featured, and has just about everything we need for our project. However, it might lean a little towards the overkill side (much like ASP .Net), and PHP is a language I'd like to avoid if at all possible.
