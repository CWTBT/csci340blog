### What was new to you?

I'm fairly comfortable with the command line in general, but
I have no experience with ruby, so installing the appropriate gems
was something I hadn't done before.

### What parts did you struggle with?

RVM. Oh God. The version of Ruby that the Debian package manager
installs is outdated, and the devs seem to just point to third-party
software to handle that issue. The installation instructions for RVM
on their website, incidentally, also gave me the wrong version of RVM,
filling my repository list up with a bunch of repositories that don't exist
and making it impossible to update anything, much less Ruby.

I probably spent about an hour doing that and then cleaning my repository
list before trying it again with a version of RVM that worked.

### What parts are you looking forward to?
* Making the blog not look like unformatted garbage
* Finding out what we're going to be using this for
* Making consistently disappointing posts

Here's some links to my favorite websites to round it out:
